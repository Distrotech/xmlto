Q: I'm trying to build xmlto on my Debian box, but it doesn't work.

A: If you get `Attempt to load network entity' errors when building
   xmlto, your system does not have the required support for XML
   Catalogs
   (http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html).
   In particular, Debian has no support for these.  Try the Fedora
   Project <http://fedoraproject.org>.
